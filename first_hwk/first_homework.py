#First method.This is not very good,but works

print ( " Hello,my friend.I want to date with you. ")
name= input ( "What is your name?" )
old= int(input("How old are you?"))
location= input ( "Where are you live?" )
print( "Hello,", name )
print( "Your age is", old )
print ( "You live in", location )

#This method better


print (" Hello, I want to date with you, user" )
name = input (" What is you name? ")
old = int (input( "How old are you? "))
city = ( input ( " Where are you from? "))
print( "Greetings ,{0}, you live in {1} and you {2} years old. " .format(name,city,old))
